Portray sincerity
Act out of loyalty
Defend your free country
Wish away the pain
Hand out lobotomies
To save little families
Surrealistic fantasy
Bland boring plain!

Hold me down in restitution
Living out your date with fusion
Is the whole fleece shun in bastard?
Don't feel guilty, master writing

Somebody said that they're not much like I am
I know I can
Make enough of the words
You go along and
I sing your song
Sickening pessimist
Hypocrite master
Conservative communist
Apocalyptic bastard?
Thank you dear God
For putting me on this Earth
I feel very privileged
In debt for my thirst!

Holy now is restitution
Living out your date of fusion
Is our whole fleece shun in bastard?
Don't feel guilty, master writing

Somebody said that they're not much like I am
I know I can
Make enough of the words
You go along and
I sing your song Downer
