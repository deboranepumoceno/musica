I gotta tell you what I'm feeling inside
I could lie to myself, but it's true
There's no denying when I look in your eyes
Girl, I'm out of my head over you

And I lived so long believing all love is blind
But everything about you is telling me this time

It's forever
This time I know and there's no doubt in my mind
Forever
Until my life is through, girl, I'll be loving you forever

I hear the echo of a promise I made
When you're strong, you can stand on your own
But those words grow distant as I look at your face
No, I don't want to go it alone

And I never thought I'd lay my heart on the line
But everything about you is telling me this time

It's forever
This time I know and there's no doubt in my mind
Forever
Until my life is through, girl, I'll be loving you forever

Yeah (yeah, yeah)

Oh, I see my future when I look in your eyes
It took your love to make my heart come alive
'Cause I lived my life believing all love is blind
But everything about you is telling me this time

It's forever
This time I know and there's no doubt in my mind
Forever
Until my life is through, girl, I'll be loving you forever

Oh, it's forever
This time I know and there's no doubt in my mind
Forever
Until my life is through, girl, I'll be loving you forever

Yeah
