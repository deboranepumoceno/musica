Remember when you were young?
You shone like the Sun
Shine on, you crazy diamond

Now there's a look in your eyes
Like black holes in the sky
Shine on, you crazy diamond

You were caught in the crossfire
Of childhood and stardom
Blown on the steel breeze
Come on, you target
For faraway laughter
Come on, you stranger
You legend, you martyr, and shine

You reached for the secret too soon
You cried for the Moon
Shine on, you crazy diamond

Threatened by shadows at night
And exposed in the light
Shine on (shine on), you crazy diamond (you crazy diamond)

Well, you wore out your welcome
With random precision
Rode on the steel breeze
Come on, you raver
You seer of visions
Come on, you painter
You piper, you prisoner, and shine
