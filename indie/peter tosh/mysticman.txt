I'm a Mystic Man
I'm just a Mystic Man

I man don't
I don't drink no champagne
No I don't
And I man don't
I don't sniff them cocaine
Choke brain

I man don't
No I don't
Don't take a morphine
Dangerous

I man don't
I don't take no heroin
No no no

(CHORUS)
'Cause I'm a man of the past
And I'm livin' in the present
And I'm walking in the future
Stepping in the future
Man of the past
And I'm livin' the present
And I'm walking in the future

I'm just a mystic man
Got to be a mystic man

I man don't
Eat up your fried chicken
Not lickin'

I man don't
Eat up them frankfurters
Garbage

I man don't
Eat down the hamburger
can't do that
I man don't
Drink pink, blue, yellow, green soda
(CHORUS)

Just a mystic man
Got to be a mystic man

I man don't
No I don't
Play fools' games on Saturday

And I man don't
No I don't
Congregate on a Sunday

Such a mystic man
Just a mystic man

Just a mystic man
Got to be a mystic man
